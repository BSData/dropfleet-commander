## Overview ##

__What's this?__

This is a GitHub repository of datafiles that allows users of New Recruit to build fleet lists for [Dropfleet Commander](https://dropfleetcommander.com/). Note that while the datafiles can be loaded into Battlescribe they use new features implemented in New Recruit and thus the ship stats, options, and other list building elements may not function correctly in Battlescribe.
